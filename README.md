## What is Caluma?

You have a process which is done manually or even on paper and you want to move into the digital world.

Your process has...

* a form focus (e.g. application, certification, ...)
* various involved users and roles
* a specific workflow of processing and decision-making

Let's make a simple example to illustrate the way Caluma works:

1. End user submits an application
2. Clerk makes an initial assessment
3. Clerk forwards the application to the responsible specialists
4. Specialists provide feedback
5. After summarizing the feedback the clerk responds to the end user

Caluma provides first class support for such use cases by providing a service that allows you to:

* Dynamically create complex forms
* Define fine-grained permissions
* Implement declarative business processes
